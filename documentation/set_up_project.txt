# Setting up Large Datasets on a New Environment

If you've cloned this project to a new environment (e.g., the school's PC), the large data files will be missing as they are excluded by `.gitignore`. Here's how to obtain or generate them:

### 1. Sample Images and Metadata (`proj3/data/images/` and `proj3/data/metadata/`)

The small sample of images and their corresponding JSON metadata files (e.g., the first 1000 entries) can be downloaded using a script:

- Navigate to the `proj3/scripts/` directory from the project root:
  ```bash
  cd proj3/scripts
  ```
- Run the `get_image_sample.py` script, specifying the number of images/metadata files you need (e.g., 1000):
  ```bash
  python get_image_sample.py 1000
  ```
- This will populate the `proj3/data/images/` and `proj3/data/metadata/` directories.

### 2. Large Synthetic Metadata (`proj3/data/metadata_big.jsonl`)

This large file (e.g., 2.7GB for 25 million entries) is used for scalability testing and is generated by duplicating the sample metadata.
To generate it (e.g., for 25 million entries, assuming your base sample in `proj3/data/metadata/` will contain 1000 files after running `get_image_sample.py`):

- Ensure the `proj3/data/` directory exists.
- Navigate to the `proj3/` directory from the project root:
  ```bash
  cd proj3 
  ```
  (If you were in `proj3/scripts/`, you'd do `cd ..`)
- Run the `dup.go` script. The `-n` flag specifies the duplication factor. If you have 1000 base metadata files and want 25 million entries, the factor is 25000.
  ```bash
  go run ./scripts/dup/dup.go -n 25000 > ./data/metadata_big.jsonl
  ```
  Adjust the `-n` value as needed based on the number of files in `proj3/data/metadata/` and your desired total size.

### 3. Unsplash Lite Dataset (`proj3/data/unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest/`)

The full Unsplash Lite dataset is quite large and needs to be downloaded manually.

- Search online for the "Unsplash Lite Dataset". It's often available on platforms like Kaggle or directly from Unsplash for research purposes.
- Download the dataset.
- Extract/place its contents into the `proj3/data/unsplash-research-dataset-lite-latest/` directory within your project structure. Ensure the file structure matches what the application might expect if it directly accesses files from this dataset (though the primary use in this project seems to be the `photos.csv000` etc. for generating `metadata_big.jsonl` or for `get_image_sample.py`).

After these steps, your project should have all the necessary data to run, including the large datasets for comprehensive testing.
